/*
 * 1. Setting Up Java:
 * 
 * Before you start coding in Java, you need to set up your development environment. You'll need the following:
 * 
 * Java Development Kit (JDK): Download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website or OpenJDK if you prefer open-source alternatives.
 * 
 *  Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code with Java extensions for a more comfortable coding experience.
 * 
 * 2. Writing Your First Java Program:
 * 
 * Let's create a simple "Hello, World!" program to get started:
 */

public class Leasson1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Unix type clear console :3
        System.out.print("\033[H\033[2J");
        System.out.flush();

        // Print something
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

/*
 * public class HelloWorld: This line declares a class named "HelloWorld."
 * 
 * public static void main(String[] args): This is the entry point of your Java
 * program. Every Java program needs a main method, and it should have this
 * exact signature.
 * 
 * System.out.println("Hello, World!");: This line prints "Hello, World!" to the
 * console.
 * 
 * 3. Understanding Basic Concepts:
 * 
 * Variables: Variables are used to store data. In Java, you need to declare a
 * variable with its type before using it. For example: int age = 25;
 * 
 * Data Types: Java has various data types, including int, double, boolean, and
 * more, which determine what kind of data a variable can hold.
 * 
 * Conditional Statements: You can use if, else if, and else statements to make
 * decisions in your code.
 * 
 * Loops: Java offers for, while, and do-while loops for repetitive tasks.
 * 
 * Functions (Methods): You can define your own functions to organize and reuse
 * code.
 * 
 * 4. Compile and Run:
 * 
 * After writing your Java code, save it with a .java extension (e.g.,
 * HelloWorld.java). Then, open your command prompt or terminal, navigate to the
 * directory where your file is located, and use the following commands:
 * 
 * javac HelloWorld.java // Compile the code
 * java HelloWorld // Run the compiled program
 * 
 * 5. Learning Resources:
 * 
 * Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, so there's a lot to
 * learn. Here are some resources to continue your Java journey:
 * 
 * Online Tutorials: Websites like Codecademy, Java Tutorials at Oracle, and
 * Java Beginners at LearnJavaOnline.org offer free Java tutorials.
 * 
 * Books: "Head First Java" by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates and
 * "Java: The Complete Reference" by Herbert Schildt are excellent choices for
 * in-depth learning.
 * 
 * Practice: Practice is key to mastering Java. Work on small projects, solve
 * coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, and collaborate
 * on open-source projects.
 * 
 * Remember that learning programming is an ongoing process, so don't get
 * discouraged by initial challenges. Keep coding, experimenting, and building
 * projects to improve your skills.
